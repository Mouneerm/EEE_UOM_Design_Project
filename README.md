Project Proposal: Smart power metering sockets for residential uses

Since energy should be saved for both economic and ecological purposes it should be 
monitored so that consummation can be visualized and reduced.

Aims and Objectives: 
The main aim of this project is to design and implement a smart plug that monitors power 
consumption and record the real power and power factor.
Furthermore, the data collected can be further processed and uploaded. A web app can be used to 
visualizes the real power and power factor in real time. Additional features such as real time 
calculation of energy cost and an internal relay to shut an outlet in case a certain amount of energy 
has been used or for remote switch on/off by IoT can be implemented.
The objectives are:
1. A literature review of existing designs and research works will be carried out.
2. Research on available microcontrollers, communications protocols and sensors and the most 
suited shall be selected.
3. A few proposals will be made, and a final design will be chosen and developed further.
4. The prototype will be tested and will be modified and improved if not meet the criteria.
5. The project will be documented by writing a report
